## Overview 
The software system is comprised of a main ROS deployement paired with a Ruby UI. The ROS nodes are the main computational components which handle direct input from sensors, motor positions, and user demands. The web interface handles user input and visual feedback for system operation. A brief block diagram is provided to highlight the system components.
