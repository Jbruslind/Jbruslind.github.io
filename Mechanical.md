## Overview 

The Mechanical system was designed with modularity and easy assembly in mind. In the future, the system may be deployed in differing areas and require an increase or decrease in dimensions. The mechanical system must be designed to accommodate changes in dimensions to fit the users needs. In addition, the system will be used by users with little to no prior knowledge of how it was designed or any institutional knowledge of how it was originally assembled. The overall system was broken up into simple sub-assemblies to streamline the manufacturing and assembly process.

## X Carriage Subassembly

The X Carriage Subassembly is the main motion platform for the HyperRail system. The assembly should allow for smooth motion along the lower 4060 T-slot track while also allowing the motor mechanism to interface to the belt track. 

The carriage assembly borrows ideas from the [Bell-Everman](https://www.bell-everman.com/products/linear-positioning/servobelt-linear-sbl)[^1] servo setup in which a static belt is used on the tracks and interfaces to a dynamic belt driven by a motor / pulley. A rack and pinion system would also work the same way (with more durability) however the realative costs were prohibitive for a system on this scale. For reference, the average cost per meter for the rack on a rack and pinion is ~$70/m whereas for this style, the belts are only ~$15/m. The projected user needs are for the system to extend up to 90ft or 30m making the rack and pinion very expensive.

One of the big advantages to this style of mechanism is the ability to easily extend the track length to various sizes without needing to purchase specially made belts/tracks. This allows the overall system to maintain "modularity" with the x-direction, which is aimed to be the longer of the axes (x length >> y, z). If the user wants to add more length, they can easily attach another section of track (4060 with static belt attachment) to the original axis and align the track pieces together so the dynamic belt is able to mesh smoothly (see the Add-On module section). 

## X Rail Assembly

The X Rail Assembly utilizes the carriage shown above combined with a track and vertical 4040 T-slot beam. The track itself is made of 4060 aluminum which was chosen for symmetry and stability (increased mass provides a good counterweight). In order for the mechanism to be stable, the carriage base needs to equally distribute mass where the most mass comes from the vertical beam + upper axis and the motor + planetary gearbox. Therefore the X Rail Assembly cantilevers the 2 largest masses against each other so the center of gravity is relatively centered within the X carriage.

The assembly is supported by a foot assembly which can be added and distributed as necessary to support the system in different environments.

These feet allow for small height adjustments on either side through an M6 bolt embedded in the design.

The pulley attached to the motor can be adjusted using the right angle brackets and can be used to provide tension to the belt system (height adjustment shown below). The whole mechanism can then be moved using the dynamic belt rolling along the static belt
