<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The HyperRail project began in [xxxx] as a way to simplify data collection within a greenhouse / growing space, specifically hyperspectral images. The main idea is to have automated data collection at certain time intervals (days, weeks, etc) which can then be compared for time-varying properties.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>The simplest approach to reliable, automated data collection over a wide area is a 3D Gantry or CNC machine. These systems have been around since the 1950s and the technology is well developed. While not normally used in outdoor applications, there are existing examples of CNC machines used in farming such as :<a href="https://farm.bot/">FarmBot</a>  , <a href="https://www.mudbots.com/concrete-3d-printers.php">MudBot</a>, and the <a href="https://www.lemnatec.com/customized-solutions/field-scanalyzer/">Scanalyzer</a>.</p>

<p>The Scanalyzer system in particular matches all the requirements for the HyperRail in that it can perform automated hyperspectral imaging of wide areas of land.</p>
