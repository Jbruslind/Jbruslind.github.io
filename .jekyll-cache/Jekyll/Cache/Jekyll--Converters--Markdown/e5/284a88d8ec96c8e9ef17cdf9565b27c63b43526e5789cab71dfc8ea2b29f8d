<p>The Mechanical system was designed with modularity and easy assembly in mind. In the future, the system may be deployed in differing areas and require an increase or decrease in dimensions. The mechanical system must be designed to accommodate changes in dimensions to fit the users needs. In addition, the system will be used by users with little to no prior knowledge of how it was designed or any institutional knowledge of how it was originally assembled. The overall system was broken up into simple sub-assemblies to streamline the manufacturing and assembly process.</p>

<p>The X Carriage Subassembly is the main motion platform for the HyperRail system. The assembly should allow for smooth motion along the lower 4060 T-slot track while also allowing the motor mechanism to interface to the belt track.</p>

<p>The carriage assembly borrows ideas from the <a href="https://www.bell-everman.com/products/linear-positioning/servobelt-linear-sbl">Bell-Everman</a> servo setup in which a static belt is used on the tracks and interfaces to a dynamic belt driven by a motor / pulley.</p>

<p>The main advantage to this style of mechanism is the ability to easily extend the track length to various sizes without needing to purchase specially made belts/tracks. This allows the overall system to maintain “modularity” with the x-direction, which is aimed to be the longer of the axes (x length » y, z). If the user wants to add more length, they can easily attach another section of track (4060 with static belt attachment) to the original axis and align the track pieces together so the dynamic belt is able to mesh smoothly.</p>
